              ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
        </h3>

          ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
